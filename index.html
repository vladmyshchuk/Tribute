      <h3 id="headline">The life of the legendary director at a glance:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Born in Flushing, New York.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1950</strong> - Due to financial hardship, the Scorsese family
          are forced to move from their suburb in Queens to Manhattan's Little
          Italy neighborhood.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1953</strong> - Scorsese's father, who is a huge film fan,
          takes him to see <em>The Magic Box</em>, a British film about the
          history of cinema. Immediately Scorsese falls in love with cinema and
          decides to be either an actor or painter when he grows up.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1960</strong> - Scorsese enrolls at NYU to study filmmaking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1964</strong> - Scorsese graduates from NYU.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1965</strong> - Scorsese gets married to Laraine Marie Brennan
          in NY. After about a year their daughter Catherine is born. Not long
          after the couple end their marriage by divorce.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1965</strong> - Scorsese receives his masters in fine arts
          from NYU.
        </li>
      </ul>

          <strong>1967</strong> - Scorsese produces his first feature film,
          <em>Who's That Knocking At My Door?</em> starring a local actor named
          Harvey Keitel. Like many of his later works, the film was about an
          Italian-American young man growing up on the rough streets of New York
          City. Scorsese's film has caught the interest of director Roger
          Corman, who becomes his mentor.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1973</strong> - Scorsese releases his first masterpiece, in my
          opinion, <em>Mean Streets</em>, a bold, violent Italian-American drama
          also set in New York City. This film also starred Keitel as well as a
          young actor name Robert De Niro. De Niro was a hit and would go on to
          star in many more of Scorsese's films.

          <em>Taxi Driver</em>, a dark, psychological story of a man descending
          into madness. Robert DeNiro's performance as the insane Travic Bickle

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1983</strong> - Scorsese creates the comedy film
          <em>The King of Comedy</em>, starring De Niro and Jerry Lewis.
          Unfortunately the movies flops at the box office but this did not stop

          <strong>1988</strong> - Scorsese releases the film
          <em>The Last Temptation of Christ</em>, based on the Nikos Kazantzakis
          novel. The film recasts Jesus as a human rather than a divine figure
          which caused much controversy. Critics praised the film but religious
          groups obviously protested it. One group even went as far as to
          fire-bomb a theater in Paris showing the film.
